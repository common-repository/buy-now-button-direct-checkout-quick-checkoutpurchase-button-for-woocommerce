== Description ==

This plugin will add a "Buy Now" button below the "Add to cart" button that add product to cart and quickly redirects the customer directly to the checkout page for a quick purchase using custom ajax call. This plugin is designed to help boost your business conversion rate by reducing the number of steps required to complete a purchase. With the "Buy Now" button, customers can be taken directly to the checkout page, skipping the traditional cart page redirect of WooCommerce.
